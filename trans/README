Contains a few diffrent versions of the translator
the first is procedural
the second is oop1
the third would be oop2 - but the current is always called translate
oop2 adds inheritance and generic programming. very cool.

oop2 is fantastically beutifull, but I doubt it works yet
I'll get to that B'e"H in the near future
